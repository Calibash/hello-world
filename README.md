# hello-world
just another repository

this is an edit made to a README. if you're paying attention to this, what's wrong with your life? You should get some sun, really - you've probably spent too much time inside if you care about this tutorial messing around.

This here is another edit that was made in the README edits branch. One that is partially influenced by watching 80s cartoon intros, and coming to the conclusion that a lot of people were doing a lot of drugs in the 80s when they designed them. Seriously, oh my god "Skeleton Warriors". On the other hand "Mysterious Cities of Gold" is just haunting. I remember seeing that show once and being unable to find it on any channel after that, so it took a bit of a mythical quality for me as a child.
